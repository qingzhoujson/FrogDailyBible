2 Timothy 3:16-17 (NIRV Bible)

16 God has breathed life into all Scripture. It is useful for teaching us what is true. It is useful for correcting our mistakes. It is useful for making our lives whole again. It is useful for training us to do what is right.
17 By using Scripture, the servant of God can be completely prepared to do every good thing.

2 Peter 1:16-21 (NIRV Bible)

16 We told you about the time our Lord Jesus Christ came with power. But we didn’t make up clever stories when we told you about it. With our own eyes we saw him in all his majesty.
17 God the Father gave him honor and glory. The voice of the Majestic Glory came to him. It said, “This is my Son, and I love him. I am very pleased with him.” (Matthew 17:5; Mark 9:7; Luke 9:35)
18 We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven. We were with him on the sacred mountain.

19 We also have the message of the prophets. This message can be trusted completely. You must pay attention to it. The message is like a light shining in a dark place. It will shine until the day Jesus comes. Then the Morning Star will rise in your hearts.
20 Above all, here is what you must understand. No prophecy in Scripture ever came from a prophet’s own understanding of things.
21 Prophecy never came simply because a prophet wanted it to. Instead, the Holy Spirit guided the prophets as they spoke. So, although prophets are human, prophecy comes from God.
