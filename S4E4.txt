Matthew 6:5-13 (NIRV Bible)

Prayer
5 “When you pray, do not be like those who only pretend to be holy. They love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners. They want to be seen by other people. What I’m about to tell you is true. They have received their complete reward.
6 When you pray, go into your room. Close the door and pray to your Father, who can’t be seen. Your Father will reward you, because he sees what you do secretly.
7 When you pray, do not keep talking on and on. That is what ungodly people do. They think they will be heard because they talk a lot.
8 Do not be like them. Your Father knows what you need even before you ask him.

9 “This is how you should pray.

“ ‘Our Father in heaven,
may your name be honored.
10 May your kingdom come.
May what you want to happen be done
    on earth as it is done in heaven.
11 Give us today our daily bread.
12 And forgive us our sins,
    just as we also have forgiven those who sin against us.
13 Keep us from sinning when we are tempted.
    Save us from the evil one.’
