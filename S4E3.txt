Psalm 119:9-16 (NIRV Bible)

ב Beth

9 How can a young person keep their life pure?
    By living according to your word.
10 I trust in you with all my heart.
    Don’t let me wander away from your commands.
11 I have hidden your word in my heart
    so that I won’t sin against you.
12 Lord, I give praise to you.
    Teach me your orders.
13 With my lips I talk about
    all the decisions you have made.
14 Following your covenant laws gives me joy
    just as great riches give joy to others.
15 I spend time thinking about your rules.
    I consider how you want me to live.
16 I take delight in your orders.
    I won’t fail to obey your word.
