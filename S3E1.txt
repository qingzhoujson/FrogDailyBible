2 Corinthians 5:16-21 (NIRV Bible)

16 So from now on we don’t look at anyone the way the world does. At one time we looked at Christ in that way. But we don’t anymore.
17 When anyone lives in Christ, the new creation has come. The old is gone! The new is here!
18 All this is from God. He brought us back to himself through Christ’s death on the cross. And he has given us the task of bringing others back to him through Christ.
19 God was bringing the world back to himself through Christ. He did not hold people’s sins against them. God has trusted us with the message that people may be brought back to him.
20 So we are Christ’s official messengers. It is as if God were making his appeal through us. Here is what Christ wants us to beg you to do. Come back to God!
21 Christ didn’t have any sin. But God made him become sin for us. So we can be made right with God because of what Christ has done for us.
