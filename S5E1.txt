Hebrews 10:23-25 (NIRV Bible)

23 Let us hold firmly to the hope we claim to have. The God who promised is faithful.
24 Let us consider how we can stir up one another to love. Let us help one another to do good works.
25 And let us not give up meeting together. Some are in the habit of doing this. Instead, let us encourage one another with words of hope. Let us do this even more as you see Christâ€™s return approaching.
