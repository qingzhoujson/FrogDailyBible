John 14:15-28 (NIRV Bible)

Jesus Promises That the Holy Spirit Will Come
15 “If you love me, obey my commands.
16 I will ask the Father. And he will give you another friend to help you and to be with you forever.
17 That friend is the Spirit of truth. The world can’t accept him. That’s because the world does not see him or know him. But you know him. He lives with you, and he will be in you.
18 I will not leave you like children who don’t have parents. I will come to you.
19 Before long, the world will not see me anymore. But you will see me. Because I live, you will live also.
20 On that day you will realize that I am in my Father. You will know that you are in me, and I am in you.
21 Anyone who has my commands and obeys them loves me. My Father will love the one who loves me. I too will love them. And I will show myself to them.”

22 Then Judas spoke. “Lord,” he said, “why do you plan to show yourself only to us? Why not also to the world?” The Judas who spoke those words was not Judas Iscariot.

23 Jesus replied, “Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them. We will come to them and make our home with them.
24 Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching. The words you hear me say are not my own. They belong to the Father who sent me.

25 “I have spoken all these things while I am still with you.
26 But the Father will send the Friend in my name to help you. The Friend is the Holy Spirit. He will teach you all things. He will remind you of everything I have said to you.
27 I leave my peace with you. I give my peace to you. I do not give it to you as the world does. Do not let your hearts be troubled. And do not be afraid.

28 “You heard me say, ‘I am going away. And I am coming back to you.’ If you loved me, you would be glad I am going to the Father. The Father is greater than I am.
