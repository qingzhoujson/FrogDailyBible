2 Timothy 2:1-6 (NIRV Bible)

Paul Again Encourages Timothy to Be Faithful
2 My son, be strong in the grace that is yours in Christ Jesus.
2 You have heard me teach in front of many witnesses. Pass on to people you can trust the things you’ve heard me say. Then they will be able to teach others also.
3 Like a good soldier of Christ Jesus, join with me in suffering.
4 A soldier does not take part in things that don’t have anything to do with the army. Instead, he tries to please his commanding officer.
5 It is the same for anyone who takes part in a sport. They don’t receive the winner’s crown unless they play by the rules.
6 The farmer who works hard should be the first to receive a share of the crops.
