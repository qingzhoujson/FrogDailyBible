Micah 6:6-8 (NIRV Bible)

6 The people of Israel say,

“What should we bring with us
    when we go to worship the Lord?
What should we offer the God of heaven
    when we bow down to him?
Should we take burnt offerings to him?
    Should we sacrifice calves
    that are a year old?
7 Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams?
    Will he take delight in 10,000 rivers of olive oil?
Should we offer our oldest sons
    for the wrong things we’ve done?
Should we sacrifice our own children
    to pay for our sins?”
8 The Lord has shown you what is good.
    He has told you what he requires of you.
You must act with justice.
    You must love to show mercy.
And you must be humble as you live in the sight of your God.

James 1:26-27 New International Reader's Version (NIRV)

26 Suppose people think their beliefs and how they live are both right. But they don’t control what they say. Then they are fooling themselves. Their beliefs and way of life are not worth anything at all.
27 Here are the beliefs and way of life that God our Father accepts as pure and without fault. When widows are in trouble, take care of them. Do the same for children who have no parents. And don’t let the world make you impure.
