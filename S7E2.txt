1 Corinthians 9:16-27 (NIRV Bible)

16 But when I preach the good news, I can’t brag. I have to preach it. How terrible it will be for me if I do not preach the good news!
17 If I preach because I want to, I get a reward. If I preach because I have to, I’m only doing my duty.
18 Then what reward do I get? Here is what it is. I am able to preach the good news free of charge. And I can do this without using all my rights as a person who preaches the good news.

Paul Uses His Freedom to Share the Good News
19 I am free and don’t belong to anyone. But I have made myself a slave to everyone. I do it to win as many as I can to Christ.
20 To the Jews I became like a Jew. That was to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one who was under the law. I did this even though I myself am not under the law. That was to win those under the law.
21 To those who don’t have the law I became like one who doesn’t have the law. I did this even though I am not free from God’s law. I am under Christ’s law. Now I can win those who don’t have the law.
22 To those who are weak I became weak. That was to win the weak. I have become all things to all people. I have done this so that in all possible ways I might save some.
23 I do all this because of the good news. And I want to share in its blessings.

Training to Win the Prize
24 In a race all the runners run. But only one gets the prize. You know that, don’t you? So run in a way that will get you the prize.
25 All who take part in the games train hard. They do it to get a crown that will not last. But we do it to get a crown that will last forever.
26 So I do not run like someone who doesn’t run toward the finish line. I do not fight like a boxer who hits nothing but air.
27 No, I train my body and bring it under control. Then after I have preached to others, I myself will not break the rules. If I did break them, I would fail to win the prize.
