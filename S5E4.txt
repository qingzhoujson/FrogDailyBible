Romans 12:3-8 (NIRV Bible)

Serving One Another in the Body of Christ
3 God’s grace has been given to me. So here is what I say to every one of you. Don’t think of yourself more highly than you should. Be reasonable when you think about yourself. Keep in mind the faith God has given to each of you.
4 Each of us has one body with many parts. And the parts do not all have the same purpose.
5 So also we are many persons. But in Christ we are one body. And each part of the body belongs to all the other parts.
6 We all have gifts. They differ according to the grace God has given to each of us. Do you have the gift of prophecy? Then use it according to the faith you have.
7 If your gift is serving, then serve. If it is teaching, then teach.
8 Is it encouraging others? Then encourage them. Is it giving to others? Then give freely. Is it being a leader? Then work hard at it. Is it showing mercy? Then do it cheerfully.

1 Peter 4:8-11 (NIRV Bible)

8 Most of all, love one another deeply. Love erases many sins by forgiving them.
9 Welcome others into your homes without complaining.
10 God’s gifts of grace come in many forms. Each of you has received a gift in order to serve others. You should use it faithfully.
11 If anyone speaks, they should do it as one speaking God’s words. If anyone serves, they should do it with the strength God provides. Then in all things God will be praised through Jesus Christ. Glory and power belong to him for ever and ever. Amen.
