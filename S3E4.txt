Matthew 7:21-27 (NIRV Bible)

True and False Disciples
21 “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven. Only those who do what my Father in heaven wants will enter.
22 Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord! Lord! Didn’t we prophesy in your name? Didn’t we drive out demons in your name? Didn’t we do many miracles in your name?’
23 Then I will tell them clearly, ‘I never knew you. Get away from me, you who do evil!’

The Wise and Foolish Builders
24 “So then, everyone who hears my words and puts them into practice is like a wise man. He builds his house on the rock.
25 The rain comes down. The water rises. The winds blow and beat against that house. But it does not fall. It is built on the rock.
26 But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man. He builds his house on sand.
27 The rain comes down. The water rises. The winds blow and beat against that house. And it falls with a loud crash.”
