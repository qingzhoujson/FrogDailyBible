Colossians 3:12-17 (NIRV Bible)

12 You are God’s chosen people. You are holy and dearly loved. So put on tender mercy and kindness as if they were your clothes. Don’t be proud. Be gentle and patient.
13 Put up with one another. Forgive one another if you are holding something against someone. Forgive, just as the Lord forgave you.
14 And over all these good things put on love. Love holds them all together perfectly as if they were one.

15 Let the peace that Christ gives rule in your hearts. As parts of one body, you were appointed to live in peace. And be thankful.
16 Let the message about Christ live among you like a rich treasure. Teach and correct one another wisely. Teach one another by singing psalms and hymns and songs from the Spirit. Sing to God with thanks in your hearts.
17 Do everything you say or do in the name of the Lord Jesus. Always give thanks to God the Father through Christ.
