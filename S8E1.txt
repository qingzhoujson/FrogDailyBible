Matthew 10:16-22 (NIRV Bible)

16 “I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. So be as wise as snakes and as harmless as doves.
17 Watch out! You will be handed over to the local courts. You will be whipped in the synagogues.
18 You will be brought to governors and kings because of me. You will be witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.
19 But when they arrest you, don’t worry about what you will say or how you will say it. At that time you will be given the right words to say.
20 It will not be you speaking. The Spirit of your Father will be speaking through you.

21 “Brothers will hand over brothers to be killed. Fathers will hand over their children. Children will rise up against their parents and have them put to death.
22 You will be hated by everyone because of me. But anyone who remains strong in the faith will be saved.
