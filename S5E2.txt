Acts 2:42-47 (NIRV Bible)

The Believers Share Their Lives Together
42 The believers studied what the apostles taught. They shared their lives together. They ate and prayed together.
43 Everyone was amazed at what God was doing. They were amazed when the apostles performed many wonders and signs.
44 All the believers were together. They shared everything they had.
45 They sold property and other things they owned. They gave to anyone who needed something.
46 Every day they met together in the temple courtyard. They ate meals together in their homes. Their hearts were glad and sincere.
47 They praised God. They were respected by all the people. Every day the Lord added to their group those who were being saved.
