1 Peter 2:13-21 (NIRV Bible)

13 Follow the lead of every human authority. Do this for the Lord’s sake. Obey the emperor. He is the highest authority.
14 Obey the governors. The emperor sends them to punish those who do wrong. He also sends them to praise those who do right.
15 By doing good you will put a stop to the talk of foolish people. They don’t know what they are saying.
16 Live as free people. But don’t use your freedom to cover up evil. Live as people who are God’s slaves.
17 Show proper respect to everyone. Love the family of believers. Have respect for God. Honor the emperor.

18 Slaves, obey your masters out of deep respect for God. Obey not only those who are good and kind. Obey also those who are not kind.
19 Suppose a person suffers pain unfairly because they want to obey God. This is worthy of praise.
20 But suppose you receive a beating for doing wrong, and you put up with it. Will anyone honor you for this? Of course not. But suppose you suffer for doing good, and you put up with it. God will praise you for this.
21 You were chosen to do good even if you suffer. That’s because Christ suffered for you. He left you an example that he expects you to follow.
