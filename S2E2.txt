Luke 7:36-50 (NIRV Bible)

A Sinful Woman Pours Perfume on Jesus
36 One of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him. So he went to the Pharisee’s house. He took his place at the table.
37 There was a woman in that town who had lived a sinful life. She learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee’s house. So she came there with a special jar of perfume.
38 She stood behind Jesus and cried at his feet. And she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair. She kissed them and poured perfume on them.

39 The Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this. He said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him. He would know what kind of woman she is. She is a sinner!”

40 Jesus answered him, “Simon, I have something to tell you.”

“Tell me, teacher,” he said.

41 “Two people owed money to a certain lender. One owed him 500 silver coins. The other owed him 50 silver coins.
42 Neither of them had the money to pay him back. So he let them go without paying. Which of them will love him more?”

43 Simon replied, “I suppose the one who owed the most money.”

“You are right,” Jesus said.

44 Then he turned toward the woman. He said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water to wash my feet. But she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.
45 You did not give me a kiss. But this woman has not stopped kissing my feet since I came in.
46 You did not put any olive oil on my head. But she has poured this perfume on my feet.
47 So I tell you this. Her many sins have been forgiven. She has shown that she understands this by her great acts of love. But whoever has been forgiven only a little loves only a little.”

48 Then Jesus said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.”

49 The other guests began to talk about this among themselves. They said, “Who is this who even forgives sins?”

50 Jesus said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”
