Ephesians 6:10-20 (NIRV Bible)

God’s Armor for Believers
10 Finally, let the Lord make you strong. Depend on his mighty power.
11 Put on all of God’s armor. Then you can remain strong against the devil’s evil plans.
12 Our fight is not against human beings. It is against the rulers, the authorities and the powers of this dark world. It is against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly world.
13 So put on all of God’s armor. Evil days will come. But you will be able to stand up to anything. And after you have done everything you can, you will still be standing.
14 So remain strong in the faith. Put the belt of truth around your waist. Put the armor of godliness on your chest.
15 Wear on your feet what will prepare you to tell the good news of peace.
16 Also, pick up the shield of faith. With it you can put out all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
17 Put on the helmet of salvation. And take the sword of the Holy Spirit. The sword is God’s word.

18 At all times, pray by the power of the Spirit. Pray all kinds of prayers. Be watchful, so that you can pray. Always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people.
19 Pray also for me. Pray that whenever I speak, the right words will be given to me. Then I can be bold as I tell the mystery of the good news.
20 Because of the good news, I am being held by chains as the Lord’s messenger. So pray that I will be bold as I preach the good news. That’s what I should do.
