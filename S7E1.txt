Genesis 12:1-3 (NIRV Bible)

God Chooses Abram
12 The Lord had said to Abram, “Go from your country, your people and your father’s family. Go to the land I will show you.

2 “I will make you into a great nation.
    And I will bless you.
I will make your name great.
    You will be a blessing to others.
3 I will bless those who bless you.
    I will put a curse on anyone who puts a curse on you.
All nations on earth
    will be blessed because of you.”

Matthew 28:18-20 (NIRV Bible)

18 Then Jesus came to them. He said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
19 So you must go and make disciples of all nations. Baptize them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
20 Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And you can be sure that I am always with you, to the very end.”
