Colossians 3:1-10 (NIRV Bible)

Teachings About Holy Living
3 You have been raised up with Christ. So think about things that are in heaven. That is where Christ is. He is sitting at God’s right hand.
2 Think about things that are in heaven. Don’t think about things that are only on earth.
3 You died. Now your life is hidden with Christ in God.
4 Christ is your life. When he appears again, you also will appear with him in heaven’s glory.

5 So put to death anything that comes from sinful desires. Get rid of sexual sins and impure acts. Don’t let your feelings get out of control. Remove from your life all evil desires. Stop always wanting more and more. You might as well be worshiping statues of gods.
6 God’s anger is going to come because of these things.
7 That’s the way you lived at one time in your life.
8 But now here are the kinds of things you must also get rid of. You must get rid of anger, rage, hate and lies. Let no dirty words come out of your mouths.
9 Don’t lie to one another. You have gotten rid of your old way of life and its habits.
10 You have started living a new life. Your knowledge of how that life should have the Creator’s likeness is being made new.
