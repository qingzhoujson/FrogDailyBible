Ephesians 6:1-4 (NIRV Bible)

6 Children, obey your parents as believers in the Lord. Obey them because it’s the right thing to do.
2 Scripture says, “Honor your father and mother.” That is the first commandment that has a promise.
3 “Then things will go well with you. You will live a long time on the earth.” (Deuteronomy 5:16)

4 Fathers, don’t make your children angry. Instead, instruct them and teach them the ways of the Lord as you raise them.
